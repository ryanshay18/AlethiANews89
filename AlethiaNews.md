Self Grade:

SELF GRADE WEEK 3: Ryan Shay: 5/5 This week was the week of rubber chickens, and pure frustration. Just hours of trouble shooting. However, the multitude of problems we faced and the hours of fixing stuff made finally fixing these problems feel great. I'm happy to say that we succesfully completed our goals that we laid out in the begginning of the week. The home pages deisgn/functionality works perfectly. And I created a temperoary logo in photoshop. And the Font is there. We also decided and implemented a template.  

SELF GRADE WEEK 3: Anthony Wilson: For this week, I deserve a 5/5 grade as I worked really hard on the code and the template. I worked on every part of the project collaboratively with Ryan, the CSS, HTML, README, the journal, etc. I believe we both put a lot of effort into the project this week and I completed all my individual goals.
