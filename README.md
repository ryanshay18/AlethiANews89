Self Grade:

SELF GRADE WEEK 3: Ryan Shay: 5/5 This week was the week of rubber chickens, and pure frustration. Just hours of trouble shooting(also why the name of this repo is weird). However, the multitude of problems we faced and the hours of fixing stuff made finally fixing these problems feel great. I'm happy to say that we succesfully completed our goals that we laid out in the begginning of the week. The home pages deisgn/functionality works perfectly which I worked on. And I created a temperoary logo in photoshop. And the Font is there. We also decided on and implemented a template.

SELF GRADE WEEK 3: Anthony Wilson: For this week, 5/5 grade as I worked really hard on the code and completed my goals. I worked on every part of the project collaboratively with Ryan, the CSS, HTML, README, the journal, etc. And I completed all my individual goals. Finishing the scrolling feature and finishing the functionaily of the home page.


Too many news networks are producing biased news reports on events that are occurring throughout politics. This is a very dangerous issue for society as the most “credible” facts they’re provided are extremely slanted by these biased authors. Additionally, when some people realize this fact, and they try to look for unbiased facts, they struggle to find a reputable source. Instead they have to go through mental gymnastics to piece together a true story. Our solution to this problem is a non-biased news platform that can provide straight facts so that the public can be properly educated. They make up their own opinions from the relevant facts we’ve laid out.
