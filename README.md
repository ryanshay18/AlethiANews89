Description
Too many news networks are producing biased news reports on events that are occurring throughout politics. This is a very dangerous issue for society as the most “credible” facts they’re provided are extremely slanted by these biased authors. Additionally, when some people realize this fact, and they try to look for unbiased facts, they struggle to find a reputable source. Instead they have to go through mental gymnastics to piece together a true story. Our solution to this problem is a non-biased news platform that can provide straight facts so that the public can be properly educated. They make up their own opinions from the relevant facts we’ve laid out.
